# Creative Writing Browser editor (CWBe)

## Description

Creative Writing Browser editor (CWBe) is a browser-based editor for writing and management of world-building notes, focused mainly on an exlorative approach. The defining features of this app are side-by-side views, the list-oriented and semantic-oriented organization and navigation, and movement of text between the main text of the work and the world-building notes. For writers with a more explorative approach, there can be a lot of writing that gets reused, placed elsewhere, or saved separately for reference. The point of this app is to enable progression through exploration.

All writing requires editing to improve. The second most important point of this app was a means of rendering drafts and receiving corrections. A full draft is compiled and downloaded as a file that a user can then send to their editors for comments and corrections. To make these comments and corrections, the editor loads the file on the view page. Once finished, their edits are compiled and downloaded as a file to send back to the writer.

**Recommendations**: There are many options for writing software and web apps, such as Scrivener which mimics a folder-binder and index card management system. Scrivener requires a monthly subscription however. Some outline-oriented editors include Manuskript, bibisco, Quoll Writer, and Trelby. Note that none of these have been tried or used, but of those mentioned, Quoll Writer seems to have the most similar setup and design philosophy. There are other tools intended for world-building as welll, such as Anvil and Campfire.

	Definition: work
	A writing project consisting of a world and multiple drafts, as well as an outline, timelines, profiles, languages, maps, and views cross-referencing between entities of these features

	Definition: draft
	A version of the writing project consisting of all chapters, sections, paragraphs, and sentences written with a working draft determining which are the most recent or used for the current arrangement.

	Definition: segment
	A contained piece of writing, i.e. chapter, section, paragraph, sentence


**What if there are no sections?**: At the beginning of a chapter, paragraphs are added to the current chapter, but if a section is encountered later on, either by ENTER, `create section`, or `###`, then the paragraphs prior are removed from the chapter, added to a section, and that section is added to the chapter before adding a new section.
