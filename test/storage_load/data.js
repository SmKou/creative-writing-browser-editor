const sample = `# Lover in the Flesh

When I look at you, I feel the stirring of affection and longing, only for resentment to flood in. Look at me. Lift your head and look at me. Would you even recognize me?

It hurts to think of those familiar eyes and that familiar face looking at me blankly with resignation, not a hint of recognition. How I hate you. I want to claw your face, dig my nails into your cheeks and shred them, but I’d stop if I saw your eyes. Though I wish I could gouge out your eyes, the sight blurs my vision with tears because I want you to recognize me and comfort me as you used to. Love me. Want me. Be mine again.

And I will maul your face.

Don’t! Not this time. This time, I will make sure it doesn’t all happen again and that’ll be easier—I hope. I will find you because I have to. Whatever this thing inside, whatever it has to do with you, I will return it to you and since you don’t know me, I will disappear before you can even hear my voice or see my face, I have to. However, I must account for the possibility that I can’t. The possibility is too high.

Whatever you feel, whether you recover your memories or not, no matter what you want, I will ensure I can’t want you. Dirty, disgusting, repulsive. How sweet. I feel so elated, thinking of it, that I’ll be free of you. So dirty I retract from you, so disgusting I can’t bear to touch you. I can smile at you from a distance.

When that moment comes.

If that moment comes.

I shouldn’t want to hurt you. I shouldn’t, but I can’t seem to find it again. The will to accept you, to care for you. I can only think of seizing you by the throat as you lower to one knee before me—just as you would. Slice into your throat with my claws. The squirt and trails of blood, red dribbling down over your collar. What I hate about you. Why I want to kill you. It’s nothing you can do anything about.

There was once upon a time, through a narrow window of opportunity, I could reconcile my weakness with my happiness at your side. Not anymore. I can’t believe it anymore. Being with you could destroy me, it could compromise me. You’re trustworthy, you always were. The one I can’t trust is me. I know, I know. It’s not your fault—it’s nothing you can change. How unfair, isn’t it—toxic even. Let’s be honest. It’s impossible for me to ever accept you and I will continue to knowingly attack you—maybe I’ll kill you this time, maybe—with all my rage and yearning. I will blame you for everything wrong with me. I know I’m wrong!

Knowingly.

Knowingly, I turn all my hate on you, and you’ve always known why. Even if you forget me, even if you don’t ever remember, you know I have to survive. I have to live. If I were to hate myself—if I were to truly hate myself, it’s not your face I’d rip off, not your throat my claws would sink into. I’d go for the heart and bleed myself dry. How long it’s been since I’ve burned, right. How long it’s been since I’ve been ripped apart limb by limb or shot by a thousand searing arrows. Oh how long it’s been since I swallowed the coals or drowned in boiling water. How long has it been since I’ve been melted—my flesh liquified and dripping from my bones!

Once upon a time, I begged someone to save me.

Once upon a time, I wanted you to be that someone.

Now, once upon a time, I’ll finish what I started. You can get in my way if you’d like. As if you’d remember, as if I’d let you. Will you finally understand me for once, the creature I am, the need to survive, to keep myself alive. You or me, if you get in my way, it’s you or me. I will finish what I started and one of us will be destroyed.

We can never exist together. It’s you or me. I hope you choose right for once.

## Mistakes

“Did you hear what’s up in Sutmen?”

“Ha. The queen returned.”

“No, no, not that! Yes, but no—she’s become the head of the Hero’s Guild.”

“The what!”

“You never heard of the Hero’s Guild.”

“It’s real, that’s what’s insane. Of course I’ve heard. Thought they were nothing but myths.”

“They were, but they’re back. They confronted the Sutmen queen’s rebellion.”

“They’re an army?”

“I don’t know—”

“Then how do you know they—”

“That part I know! They confronted the queen and stopped when the people came out to protect her from them. She was protecting them! They were supposed to be hiding! But when one of the heroes got close enough to attack her, the people burst into the streets and ran at them.”

“Ha! Well, the Hero’s Guild can’t harm the people they hope to be heroes for.”

“Right.”

“Right?”

“Right!”

“Oh.”

“Now she leads the Hero’s Guild!”

The two men stood. Sounding congested and wheezy, the man who brought up the gossip began recounting the full story that had reached Yanmen, and they walked out, one never breaking his stride or turning to look as the wheezy one, clinging to his narrative, had to weave around an incoming customer. Despite all the chatter in the air, the gossip was overheard and spread to other tables. It wasn’t obvious at first, whispers bouncing, a segue here and then there, a cry of “To the queen!” devolving into laughter. Clearly, the people here were all interested. They didn’t care who ruled Sutmen. They cared about a good story.

More than twenty years ago, an uprising of peasantry stormed the western palace. Two princesses managed to escape the beheading, but they were soon hunted down and surrounded. The five-year-old princess tripped and the older princess was forced to leave her behind to get away. It was laughed about, a joke that distracted the people from the true oppressers they’d just helped to enthrone. There was merry-making and celebration, then came the soldiers and the taxes. The insurrectionists were either executed for petty crimes or detained, sold, and sent away in the middle of the night. Within a few years, no one remained from the uprising and soon, the people of western Sutmen realized what had really happened.

The princess was thirteen when she escaped. She wasn’t the eldest, youngest, or favored. Among her siblings, she was insignificant, so much so that she looked poorer than the peasants that had hunted her and her sister down. She was shamed for not staying with her sister, she was shamed for running from her family’s execution. The people blamed her for the nobles that overtook the throne. It’s a wonder she returned.

She returned as a sorceress in command of many malicious spirits, of maladies. For now, she protects her people and makes her advance towards the capital city. In her wake follow peasants, slaves, and nobles alike. When soldiers see her, they stop and turn on their commanders, if their commanders don’t turn with them. First, when she appeared on the edge of the lawless middle lands, there were cries of her sorcery. She was using her power, but by now, with her story spreading, there’s no enchantments, no coercion, she’s the true queen who has returned to free her people. There’s no mention of the maladies unleashed on the towns and cities as she approaches, only once she arrives, when the gates have opened and the people are willing.

Anyone reminding others that she’s a sorceress is immediately silenced by the crowd. How unfortunate, how fun. For now, she strides ahead, closing in on the capital, celebratred as the liberator of her people. Whether she actually will or what she’s actually there for, it’s for them all to find out.

Until then, I’m here in central Yanmen, far from her rebellion. What I’m really here for are the two tables in back. Unlike the rest, they’re set in another room, separated from this one by a dark purple curtain. Directly facing one another, the two tables between them, are a man and woman in love with one another. The woman hopes he can see her speaking to some of the other men. He can and the jealousy she hopes does arise, but he makes no move to stop any of it. The man has decided not to involve himself with her anymore because love hurts.

And that’s what I’m here for.

Their fate is to reunite. They’re a compatible couple that has developed the care and feelings needed for lasting relationships. But I have no interest in happy endings or consolation. My target isn’t the woman with her tricks—she’s been herself from the start. Her intentions had always been to make him fall in love with her. The only change was why she wanted him to. The man, on the other hand, made a choice. He chose to give up his resistance and his distance to love her openly.

It was sweet, then he discovered that she’d approached him for revenge. All her feelings, he believed, were for the man she sought revenge on, in spite of knowing her, having seen her all too clearly love him. Still he made another decision: no more. Before she could hurt him anymore, he’d take back the distance he’d given up. Of course she is as much to blame as he is by this point—I won’t forget her, but he’s first.

When have I ever cared for what’s fair?

Unable to stand it, the man stands and leaves the room. She saw him excuse himself and hesitated, only to be caught, unable to follow him after all. He makes his way out to the stalls in back. Once out the door, he avoids the stalls and walks past the lights of back doorsteps and the stalls of other houses. In his mind, he remembers her. He’s angry, he’s torn, he’s broken. When he finally stops, he realizes he’s stopped in one of the public gardens.

He breathes in the cold air of evening, the frost dusting his cheeks. With lanterns lit throughout the garden, he can see all the shrubs with leaves of magenta and pink, the trees with yellowing and blue leaves, green and black grasses, teal and red moss climbing trees and creeping through the grasses, and the recently replaced cobble stone paths. Looking down, he sees the sweeper, an elderly upright man swaying side to side, humming. With both hands, the sweeper holds onto a broom with a wrapped handle and sweeps the stone to the rhythm of his humming. Watching for a moment and unable to look away, the man finds himself drawn down the paths. The paths wind through the garden, lowering through the levels, and all the while, he hears the elderly man’s happy humming and the sweeps of the broom’s bristles. As he nears, he stares at the elderly man’s face, standing in his way.

After a moment, the elderly man looks ahead and sees the man. His peaceful smile becomes welcoming. What a stiff young man, he thinks, and approaches, bringing his broom like a present. He holds it out, gently coaxing the man to take it and sweep a ltitle.

On any other day, the man would’ve thought the gesture insulting. Sweeping was such a lowly task and in a public garden of all places. Instinctively, the thought arose and almost came to the forefront of his mind, but he was too numb for it to form. Thinking of the elderly man’s smile, he reached out and firmly grasped the broom. As he pulled it back into his hands, the elderly man’s hands fell away and met behind his back. The man did not move. He stared blankly at the broom in his hands. The elderly man waited. It took several moments before mechanically, the man lowered the broom and began to sweep. Turning around, he continued the elderly man’s task. The elderly man followed from a few steps behind him and resumed humming.

I hadn’t yet decided when the elderly man finally noticed something amiss. He stopped and looked in my direction. Though he didn’t see me at first, he stopped relying on his eyes and I appeared to him. He paled with fear, staring at me. His lips parted, forming silent words, and closed. When I didn’t move, it occurred to him what I was actually here for and stole a glance at the man still sweeping. Horrified, the elderly man looked at me again. Now he mouthed his words, quietly uttering them in his throat. “Take me,” he pleaded, “This young man, let him live—I’ve lived mine, take me.”

I stared back at the elderly man. He was trembling, thinking of his wife and son. Both have passed before him. Though he was happy and at ease, he was just waiting to join them. However, last I checked, there aren’t any reapers in this land, though he could be confusing me with the guardians of heaven, hell, and paradise. All of them were winged like me. They weren’t wingedfolk, so their wings were and weren’t part of their bodies. One would know when they looked. The wings themselves seemed to rise up behind them like a great flowing cloak of either darkness or light. They were their own large, looming presence. To the elderly man, it looked as if mine did too, so he mistook me for one of them. It took staying motionless as the fear and desperation wore off for him to realize there was neither light nor darkness beneath my wings. It was glass and he could see his reflections.

“Who are you,” he muttered.

What was I supposed to tell him?

At that moment, the man stopped sweeping, realizing the air was off around him. There was no humming or presence behind him. When he turned around, he found the elderly man a ways behind him, staring at another point in the garden. By the look of his face, the man felt concern. He looked over in my direction. He couldn’t see me either, and didn’t know in what way to adjust his sight, though he rightfully wondered if there was a ghost here.

With his mind clear, his thoughts returned to the woman and their relationship. The elderly man saw me narrow my eyes. He looked at the man, the broom held aside, thinking about something. “What,” he called, “What’s on your mind, young man?”

The man looked at him, then at where I was, still seeing nothing. Slowly, he began to tell the elderly man of recent events. With each mention of the woman, his voice broke a little more and his agitation contorted his face with anguish. As soon as it seemed he might start shouting, the anger flashing in his eyes, he stopped short. He swallowed all the rest down and felt a bitter taste in his mouth. The elderly man watched him with concern and confusion. When he looked at me, I gestured for him to move. The elderly man was stubborn. He asked the man about the woman he’d fallen for—even if that was her goal from the start, since he fell in love, could he forgive her?

Wrong question.

Then the words the man kept to himself were spoken: no more. While the elderly man sympathized, he was left even more puzzled as to why I was here for the man. Since the man couldn’t see me, I couldn’t be the woman, could I be. He stole another glance at me and I shook my head. That surprised him. The man noticed him flinch and looked again in my direction. “Sir,” he said softly, “What are you seeing?”

The elderly man felt the instinct to clamp his mouth shut. However, the urge passed and he admitted that he saw what he thought was a guardian, but why, he wondered, my wings were unlike any he’d heard of. The man wondered what my wings were like. The elderly man mentioned the look of glass and their reflections, then he noticed that the feathers of my wings were shades of blue, purple, and white with spots. This puzzled both of them. Neither knew what to say anymore. The elderly man stared at me and the man could only wonder, yet he didn’t stop trying to see, not wanting to think about her again. He remembered the dinner and the guests, but all too quickly he saw her speaking with other men again. With the shake of his head and looking away with pain and hopelessness, the elderly man suddenly realized what I was here for, then he knew what I was and became incensed.

“Stay away,” he cried, swatting in my direction as if I were a fly in his proximity, catching the man by surprise. “He doesn’t need any of you!”

I could feel the smirk, listening to him. No one ever needs a malady.

The man figured out what I was and realized why he couldn’t see me, but instead of being afraid or wanting me to leave him alone, for a moment, he wanted to see me. What malady was I? Every child was taught of the maladies, singing the rhymes and re-enacting their stories, and when a new one arose, it was as if a new villain had appeared on stage for the hero in a play to defeat. It seemed the man was one of those children that read all about the maladies like reading fairytales and epic adventures. He’d only ever met a malady once in his life and it was at such a young age that he couldn’t remember. How lucky. All the old feelings of excitement, fear, and revelry were unconsciously stoked. He was still present, now having resumed the facade of derision and indifference he’d cultivated for his work. The feelings were just the feelings of a child and he knew a malady was a serious matter.

Both of them knew they weren’t powerful enough to confront a malady, not one of the larger ones. Neither wanted to give in and admit it was futile. I, myself, felt my malice settling, though I couldn’t feel pity. If I explored his memories a bit or recalled his story with the woman, it’d stir once more.

Should I bring the woman here? It was a possibility. One chance. If they failed.

Why would I bother?

The elderly man hadn’t thought it through, but the man did and silently, he surrendered himself. Even if the elderly man got in my way or fetched people to dispel me, I could just take them all. There was one reason, though, why I hadn’t yet infected them. As a malady, it was a rather inconvenient trait—in my design, that was the point.

The elderly man yearned for his wife and waited to reunite with her. Their lives had been simple, filled mostly with work and dinners with family. The only event in their lives of any great impact was the loss of their son. He’d just become engaged.

Until recently, the man’s life was the same. He came from an affluent family, yet his life was just work and dinners, hardly any deviance, and if he’d never met the woman, he might never have a moment of great impact either. Great impact. I don’t know why I call it that. Grief. Betrayal. That was the pain that called to me. He made his choice and he chose to go back on it to protect himself from pain. Now it’s my turn.

The elderly man tried to push the man away and block him off, but my malice consumed them. It consumed everything. All the lights and plants became blood red. Both men fainted.

The man dreamed of overhearing the woman admit why she approached him. He didn’t question where he was. Peeking out, he saw the woman was talking to the man she approached him for, the one she wanted revenge on, and when that man moved to embrace her, she sighed with relief and smiled with yearning. Her smile became tranquil as she was held by the other man. He stepped back, shaking, and when he turned to leave, he was stopped short, his servant in front of him and listened to the apology that made him think it was all fake, all for her revenge. When he turned again, there he was at the gardens, watching her wait for him from the shadows. So many questions in his head. With not one certainty, this was the moment he chose not to involve himself with her anymore. He turned away, only to receive the apology again.

Every time he turned away, he only turned to another one of these moments. He couldn’t tell everything was repeating or even out of order, he just kept living from one moment to the next as if it hadn’t happened yet. Worst of all for him was that he didn’t realize one of these moments was fake. The apology and choice were actual memories. In the fake memory, he didn’t notice how he seemed too close for where he was standing, how he could hear in spite of their soft voices, or that from his angle, he shouldn’t have been able to see her expressions. If he’d stopped and noticed where he was and where he was standing relative to them, he’d have realized all these things too easily, but all he could think of was her and couldn’t stop.

The elderly man, I didn’t feel like faking his. The only moments to torture him with were the deaths of his wife and son. There was grief but no betrayal, neither from him or either of the two he yearned for. Just loss. Such uneventful lives. That was a grief I couldn’t touch, so I killed him.

The elderly man sighed in his sleep and died. He had no ghost and his soul manifested from his body. One of the guardians should be coming to guide his soul. I could simply collect him myself and hand him off the next time I encountered a guardian. This small town was close to one of the entrances to hell, but I doubted a guardian of hell was coming for him. It’d be a minute or two.

Shades of dark red and crimson intermingled, just like blood, it was everywhere. The leaves of the trees and shrubs, blades of grass, patches of moss were all blood red. Even the lanterns strung up around the garden glowed and radiated a sinister red. It even spilled out of the garden onto the gates, the fences and the talismans pasted on them, and once coated and dripping, it reached the roads. Where there was no fence, the red spread across the ground to the stalls and back doorsteps. The red soon covered enough of the street, the stalls, and backsteps to be noticed by the people. They thought it was blood, an insane amount of blood draining from somewhere such as a massive pile of fresh corpses. Enough people screamed, cried out, hurried away that the braver ones soon gathered and walked against the flow, reaching the fences of the public garden. The people in stalls scrambled into the houses. Few dared to investigate there and of those that did, they lost their nerve and joined the crowd in the street.

There were those few that noticed things were covered too much with this red substance and rightfully realized it wasn’t blood but malice. What kind of malice was this? Each of these ones got swept up in the crowd, their realizations fleeting or dismissed. The people shouted themselves into a frenzy, readying themselves to storm the gates. Some of them were armed with weapons, talismans, and musical instruments. Ghosts were the second most unwelcome beings in these lands, so it only made sense they had these things at the ready so fast, but their disdain for the magical arts meant they couldn’t tell if their talismans were drawn correctly or if properly spelled, if their tunes were on or off pitch or even the right ones for their purpose, and if their weapons were actually blessed or just silvered.

I heard the flap of wings and a rain of gold-tipped black feathers fell upon the garden. The people outside went silent. Seeing a guardian fly in overhead dissolved their courage and even after it was out of sight, they muttered and tried to talk themselves up and down. The guardian landed across from me, their feathers whirling and whipping around through the garden until they located the elderly man’s soul cowering in one of the bushes.

I was surprised by this one. It wasn’t a guardian, it was a ghost light. The elderly man’s soul was brought to the ghost light who raised their lantern and greeted him by name. The soul entered the lantern and for a moment, its light was blue. Five whirling orbs could be made out through its paper.

Ghost lights were a rather new classification in these lands, in part because they all came from the same city. This far from it meant either the elderly man worshipped the city’s deity or he’d once lived there. If the latter, then it’s both. The residents of the city were all rather devout towards their city’s deity—she was pretty proactive and powerful after all.

The ghost light faced me. They were an androgynous, rabbitfolk ghost, and oddly young. What really caught my attention was the wings. Like me, they obviously weren’t a wingedfolk, their wings hovering around them like a cloak and beneath them was neither darkness nor light. Instead, beneath their gold-tipped black wings were shadows, frightening manifestations from the realm of shadow. Though everywhere and in everything, shadows were often stagnant without any consciousness or awareness. The shadows beneath their wings were swirling and twisting sludge-like black masses full of faces, either wide with disturbing smiles or long with contorting groans, large gaping eyes, and wide grinning mouths that all formed from and faded back into black. Any mortal that saw it was often terrified of the implications.

When I saw it, I felt calm and relieved. How familiar. I wish the shadow god was here.

“Did you kill him?”

I nodded. “Do you believe I did?”

“Yes, but…”

“I didn’t infect him.” My malice receded, the red everywhere seeming to dry up and fade. The lights were no longer red, neither the stones, the gates and roads, but all the plants remained blood red and the wood of the fences retained stains. Outside, my receding malice wasn’t noticed yet.

Their brows knitted together with consternation. They noted the lessening red, glanced over, and spotted the man’s body, the elderly man’s body not far from his. “So he was your target.” They studied the man. Though infected, he’d yet to manifest any symptoms.

“Do all of you have wings now?”

They turned and stared at me.

“Ghost lights are known for walking the roads at night. But your wings. Those were given to you. Did you ask for them?”

Their head lowered, their gaze darkening. “Why do you ask?”

I couldn’t help but smile, wanting to comment on their design. Fortunately and unfortunately, it was a rule of mine that I couldn’t disclose or indicate my identity. My rules were binding contracts I placed on myself, so one of these contracts kept my mouth shut and my tongue still. So what did I answer? Ignoring that I’m a malady, what would be a valid, unthreatening reason to know whether the ghost lights had wings or not. “I’d like to know.”

“Why.”

“Because. I’d like to be able to recognize someone I’m looking for.” That shocked them, then they were suspicious. “Why wouldn’t you recognize them? How would wings—”

“I haven’t met them yet. Not in this life—all I have is,” I gestured at my chest. Frowning, they focused, studying, listening—and heard two heartbeats. Their eyes widened and they couldn’t tear their attention away. “Wings like yours make a difference whether I will be able to distinguish them or not.” That snapped them to. They didn’t have the knowledge to question me any further, and someone who knew would’ve called bullshit.

“You think they’re in Ghost City?”

I didn’t. I knew they weren’t there. The person I was looking for was deep in Suuriratke’s territory. “Not really. I think they might end up there. Like you.” That both shocked and troubled them. They looked conflicted as they delved into the memory of their death. Though every ghost light chose to assume their position, it was only an option to them if they died a certain way: suicide.

They made a decision, one I wasn’t expecting and seemed truly irrational. The ghost light offered to bring me back to Ghost City. “You think that’s safe?”

“No.”

They wanted me to be sure I could find them.

Such a young ghost light. The ones that chose to become ghost lights were usually older as in middle-aged or elderly. This one looked to be late teens, early twenties, a rabbitfolk who’d hidden their body away with some spell they bought and regretted it when no one could find them. It’s still there, it seems, lying there for decades, preserved from decay and safe from consumption. By the time their deity offered to retrieve it, there was no one to claim it anymore.

“Then I will follow your lead.”

A crowd surrounded the garden just beyond the fences. Among them was the members of the man’s party, including the woman who was looking for him. Becoming increasingly frightened, she worried that he was here with whatever the source of red was.

The ghost light descended to the path below and approached the elderly man cautiously. They didn’t venture too close, staring at the man. “What about him?” The signs of my malady were starting to show, first appearing as a bump or tiny scar. They were growing into long, deep claw marks on the face. Black spots appeared all along his throat in various sizes, deepening. “Will he?”

The people finally noticed the red was all gone. Rather than assuage their fear and panic, it heightened as people yelled out that the wrath was preparing to leave the garden, the soul eater was done with their hunt and would go mad, the arachne or the cut-tailed vixen was mocking them before it descended upon them.

“He might not. It’s up to them. Some sleep forever, others give up and die.”

“Do any ever wake?”

None of the wild speculations yelled out in the crowd especially frightened the woman any more than another until someone yelled it was a ghost bride. It almost drove the woman crazy with terror. What if, what if, she could see a ghost bride enchanting the man, the ceremony, and finally, the poisonous kiss that killed his body and bound his soul to the ghost bride. She tore through the crowd and ran right through the gates into the garden, deaf to all the shouts and calls of her name behind her.

“You can watch.”

The woman burst past the treeline overlooking the garden, immediately laying eyes on the ghost light. Believing them a guardian, she frantically searched  and spotted the man below. She stole a glance at the ghost light who stared back at her. Without another thought, she ran downhill straight through the shrubs, past the trees, over the grass, ignoring the way of the stone paths. Hair caught and pulled, tiny scratches and bruises, tripping, tumbling, she never took her eyes off him, calling his name, so scared he was dead and she prayed, prayed so hard that she cried from the pain of loss and the pain of all the little wounds as she ran. When she reached him, she had such momentum that she tripped over him. She was too scared to think of the pain, landing close to the ghost light, and scrambled back to the man’s side.

Once she saw his face and throat, she couldn’t even scream. She tried to raise him and wrapped him in her arms. She didn’t know what to do and tore a sleeve with her teeth, draping it over his throat to cover the holes forming, breaking the skin. Crying, calling his name, she turned to the ghost light, screamed and pleaded with them as if they were a guardian. They ignored her, lowering to pick up the elderly man, and she finally noticed the lantern.

The ghost light glanced at me. “She can’t even see you, can she.”

“She can,” I assured, “I just don’t look the same to her. I’m not noticeable in comparison.”

“Hm.”

Did they have him, were they going to take his soul and bring it to Ghost City—a place she’d never reach. She cried pitifully and begged. This time, she said something that caught the ghost light’s attention, something that had them remembering something from long ago. I didn’t catch it. She’d inadvertently found a weakness and she could see it. Just as she was about to use it, the ghost light looked at me. She followed their gaze. In her eyes, she saw a living bloodfolk standing on a higher level in the garden, their hair floating and shifting with a silvery wind surrounding them. The ghost light didn’t know what she saw, but they could see that she was seeing someone here too.

“What is the cure,” they called out.

“Cure?”

“The cure. For him.”

The woman realized I was a malady and the man was afflicted. Her mind blanked, trying to recall the maladies and their symptoms. She finally saw he was breathing and just sleeping. He didn’t even look in pain despite the deterioration of his face and throat.

“Can you still love him,” I called out, “if his face is gone?”

She whipped her head up, looking at me. “What.”

“None of it can be reversed.” They wanted a cure. A cure. Since they asked, “He will wake when he realizes he’s dreaming.”

The people were entering the garden. With the elderly man in arms and the lantern in hand, the ghost light prepared to fly, but the woman caught their robes with a cry of “Don’t—!” Her expression was full of despair and desperation. The ghost light looked between the man and woman and noted the people appearing from the treeline. The people of these lands were frightened of guardians, but once they realized it was a ghost light, they’d all storm in to attack them. Like their city, ghost lights were widely abhorred and were even hunted in some places. Not to be facetious but, in such places, the dead tended to be more violent and restless. It’s almost as if lost souls and ghosts needed some kind of guiding light.

I released my malice. All the people screamed and retreated, believing it was blood and fire. They didn’t leave though. Some tiny bit of courage or doubt or whatever managed to anchor most of them. As the red spread and seeped into their pores, it would do the same to them as it did the man, or rather something similar. “These people will sleep soon.”

The ghost light stole a glance at me. They were no more decided and looked at the woman, helpless. Frozen. Either I had to infect all these people—that sounded disgusting—or we leave now. Oh, there’s a stubborn one.

Fuck.

My legs transformed into a long serpentine tail and I dove towards them, my wings doubling once then twice in size. The woman saw me coming right at them. As I arced up, she grabbed onto my tail and shoved the man over. The people were too stunned. Some had fainted and some watched us ascend. As I rose, the woman was still hanging off. My wind gathered beneath her and helped her onto my tail, then with my wind, she repositioned the man.

I was alone for a moment, then the ghost light arrived beside me, the elderly man still in their arms. Those were pretty fast, strong wings. They wanted to question me, ask me what I was—a stupid question usually, but recalling where they were from, it was practical. Instead, they chose not to ask. They had two missions and a personal objective at the moment: their lantern, the body, and the two on my tail.

With the ghost light guiding the way, we crossed distances even faster than flying alone would. Anuukal’s sunlight faded, revealing all the sprites drifting through the atmosphere in a sea of pulsing lights. Most were far above or far below, we didn’t have to evade more than a few.

As we soared, my wind was needed to keep the man and woman warm amidst the blistering cold and the feeling of a wall of icicles persistently shooting at them. A pair of whisperingfolk like them, a word would’ve been enough, but one was asleep, his face and throat deteriorating away, and the other was too terrified to utter a sound. She’d cried, a hiccup escaping her, then fell silent once more. Though she couldn’t see the continued deterioration, she saw it when she closed her eyes—it was already much worse—and clung to him as hard as she could as if she were the one keeping him on my tail.

The ghost light kept stealing glances back at the woman.

Waking him would be a miracle. The fact I was bringing them with me to Ghost City was so ridiculous—or that I was following a ghost light to Ghost City. I wasn’t expecting anything like this. In the least, I thought I’d be traveling by cart or beast. Flying with my wings and wind. There was a time I used to saw these wings off, yet they always grew back. At some point, I’d taken to slicing them off once a week while they were still manageable. To be using them now.

It did occur to me to note the names of the man and woman, but I didn’t want to make any acquaintances. What would happen to them once we reached Ghost City, there was no going back for them. I shouldn’t have killed that elderly man. If I hadn’t, what would he have tried?

“What’s the cure?”

“The cure.” The ghost light expected a straightforward answer, something like a spell, potion, or regimen, except for those I infect, if the cure was any of those things, it’s because it had been considered so by the afflicted before. With this man, I doubted any of that mattered much to him more than contracting Cold or a morning jog. Speaking of Cold, who asks a malady what their cure is.

“What do people call you?” They thought I didn’t want to say it.

“What I’m called.” Funny. All maladies are named. I didn’t think of it until this moment and I suppose it’s as much of a name as Cold is. “Heartbreak.”

They didn’t hear right, they thought, then they registered that they had. “No.” The ghost light looked back. I shouldn’t be smiling but watching one realization after another dawn on them, their expression growing more and more devastated with each second, it’s fun. One could see when they reached the only conclusion there was: I have no cure.

I could see Ghost City below, a walled city full of lights and shifting shadows. From above, the little goddess’s barriers resembled layers of crystal held together by intricate loops of spider silk. Even from this far, the barrier sensed us and a ripple of moonlight disturbed its surface, forming a flat-looking eye that studied me as we approached. “Still think it’s alright bringing me here?”

The ghost light’s face hardened. “Heartbreak, was it.” They glared at me. “They’re your responsibility.”

“Responsibility, you sure?”

Though I knew what they were thinking, it didn’t make sense. It was pretty funny to humor the idea, so I had my laugh. They quickly recovered their senses and sighed. The eye faded back into the barrier. The ghost light looked disappointed as we descended.

## Hot Spots

The city was fully illuminated by all kinds of creatures: ghost fire, witch fire, sprites, nature spirits, and the nature god’s moonlight. Much of the city was grid-like, separated into nine sectors distinguishable from above by rooftop colors, styles, and material, as well as wide boulevards spanning north-south and east-west from end to end. Rivers ran straight through the city, splitting into smaller rivers and narrow canals, some gathering at a lake in the northwestern sector. In the eastern sector, near to the city walls, there was a palace. Unlike much of the rest of the city, as if built atop a lake, the palace was illuminated by moonlight on the water, as well as oil lamps and chandeliers in its open corridors.

While there was plenty of activity in the ring of  outer sectors, the center was bustling and teeming with people. People were getting around by boat, cart, and beast, if they didn’t have wings, gliders, or spell-casted orbs, boards, and carpets. They crossed the rivers by bridge and by boat hopping. The air was filled with all the smells of food as if their smoke and steam formed its own atmosphere. Beneath it was a tumultuous sea of smells: perfumes, flowers, dirt roads and pavement, gardens, wet wood, unpolished wooden beams, paint, clay, stone, rotting flesh, blood, livestock and beastfolk, washed and unwashed bodies.

The ghost light dropped down in front of the main building of a large temple on the southern edge of the central sector. It was built in the style of a house of leisure, surrounded by bamboo-filled courtyards and tall, gazebo-style shrines. Through the open doors, it resembled a bureau, except filled with priests and their apprentices and attendants. They wore fitted sea blue uniforms and like open winter jackets, brown and white worship robes with high collars.

Watchers stood on all of the surrounding rooftops, hooded figures with long shadows wearing ceramic funerary masks without any holes. Their arms were exposed, and they wore linen shirts and pants. They looked to be men and women, elders, adults, and teenagers with ghoulish hands and arms, made up of windfolk, stonefolk, and runesfolk. Some were crouched low, turning their heads as if watching everything closely. These ones didn’t wear cloaks, their shirts had hoods, and while ghoulish, more concerning were their long, curving black claws, whipping tails, and twitching rows of sharp spines down their backs. I looked at one long enough that its funerary mask turned to me and it felt as if it were staring at me.

The woman stood and looked at the man, distressed, wondering how she was going to move him and hoping I’ll continue to carry him. The man’s face was splotchy with patches of flaking, aggravated skin. The deep claw marks had formed and spread, melding together, and the skin of these areas were now raw and rough. Holes riddled his throat. It was more and more coming to resemble porous rock. If one looked through them, they’d see the inside of his throat.

I couldn’t control the rate of deterioration. The rapid progress of my infection’s aesthetic was too fast for even me to enjoy, but the fact that it was so fast meant he’d had an underlying, if not blatant, hatred for his face. That, or there was a growing desire to tear it off and throw it away. He’d been affluent, handsome, and highly skilled, coming from a family of noble heritage. One of the first things to attract the woman to him was his face, but that’s how my infection was working on him. He’d rather have no face than his own.

It’s all worked out this way. I would have gone to infect the woman if the ghost light hadn’t appeared. Earlier, when I released my malice a second time, there was a chance she wouldn’t have been infected. Her proximity, though, meant she’d breathed some in and physical contact meant my malice had time to seep through her skin. For now, it’s not obvious. It will be once she’s alone.

“Come.” The ghost light turned and entered.

My wings were back to their usual size. I didn’t change my tail and carried the man in with me. It was the smallest amount of relief the woman could feel as she strode in beside him. She reached for his face, only for her hand to stop and retract, then she reached out anyway and brushed aside his hair. Her hand lingered and gently, trying not to accidentally scratch him, she pressed the side of her finger to part of his cheek and stroked one small spot that still had skin. The speed of his deterioration will make this impossible soon and she’d noticed.

The ghost light walked up to a desk. There sat a priest, an oxenfolk devil with a kind smile. He had green and blue arrow markings round his eyes, collarbone, and visible joints. Like most in the room, he had long hair, his black, tied with a lavender ribbon.

A watcher came and took the elderly man’s body. They turned their head to the priest. Their ceramic funerary masks had no holes and contoured to their faces, so they couldn’t speak. The priest took a moment to consider how long the elderly man’s soul might take to acclimate to the shadows. He shook his head. “Let him lie.” With a nod, the watcher carried the body away.

The ghost light held up their lantern. The priest welcomed four souls as they drifted out. Only one did he address by name, the elderly man, and welcomed him back home, he said his wife was waiting for him. The ghost light stepped aside, gesturing to me, speaking a different dialect from before. As if I wouldn’t understand, not that they knew though. Leaning in their chair, the priest looked around me at the woman, glanced at the man, and nodded. They addressed the ghost light, “No worries, you can go.”

The ghost light didn’t want to. They glanced at the woman, the man, then turned and left.

Holding up his hand, the priest kept the souls in his proximity. They drifted and circled round his hand as he pulled a ledger from the side in front of him. He took a brush, dipped it in ink, then tapped each cell in a row on four rows. With each tap, the dab of ink it left moved and formed characters and numbers. He read over the rows and gave a nod.

“I’ll be one moment.”

The woman nodded. She didn’t have to.

The priest stood and walked the souls to a doll-sized altar in the wall, opening a door behind it just the size to fit one’s hand. The priest waved each of them off, uttering well wishes to each by name, as the souls went through the door.

Once the fourth went through, he closed the door and returned to the desk. “Hello then.” The priest stopped and frowned, looking at the two somewhere down my tail. He looked at me. Following his suspicion, he reached in his desk and pulled out the latest model of malice detector their little goddess developed. The priest held it up, the back facing us. “Reveal,” he whispered.

My malice materialized in the impression and filled it, light seemed to move under the engravings moving left, right, up and down just as a needle on a meter would. What caught the priest off-guard was that the light turned magenta and cobalt blue. The priest looked horrified, only seeing the red of my malice and that the light had changed color, and not only one. He didn’t know if that was good or bad.

Slowly, the priest lowered the detector and slipped it back into his desk. He’d just pushed the drawer shut, then pulled it out with such force and looked at it again. He took out a beige paper-covered almanac, a sheet of paper, a stylus and its pusher. When he inserted the pusher, it almost went down the full length, he’d have to replace the cartridge soon.

As he recorded the measurements from the malice detector, he called over another priest. A priest and priestess who’d been discussing something written in one of their manuals came over and stared in shock when they saw the malice detector. The priest remarked he’d never seen such a thing, while the priestess said she’d heard of the light changing before, but to the same color as the malice, this was strange. The three were so invested in figuring out the readings that at some point, I lied down and curled up a bit, pulling the man closer, and so the woman, to the desk. When the priest finally looked up, he saw I wasn’t there, the woman pointed down, and he shifted his attention back to the readings and the priest and priestess with him, making an offhand gesture for her to come closer and take a seat.

The woman glanced down at me. Her gaze shifted to the man. By now, his whole face was gone. From now on, he’d always look as if rats had just eaten it all off, aside from part of his eyelids and thin partial layers of skin left on his lips and nose. The full column of his throat was riddled with holes, so porous that it was no longer porous rock but deep and misshapen honeycomb. He wouldn’t deteriorate anymore than this, and since we’re in Ghost City, they could just get him another face and throat cover, or apply a second skin with his original face and throat. The woman couldn’t help but stare, thinking of the face she remembered, trying to avoid looking, and already, gathering courage to lean in and look him in the eyes, even kiss him. What laborious mental exercise.

She hesitated to leave the man, so I shifted my tail and dumped him in one of the chairs. She immediately rushed over and moved his head. Despite looking ravaged, he didn’t feel it, so her concern over it and his discomfort was unnecessary. She righted his posture and fussed over his hair being in his face, if any dust went in his throat or if he’d been scratched by the chair’s fabric, not that it’d be discernible if it had. Rather than sit in another chair, she squeezed herself in with him to rest his head on her shoulder. The trouble she went to in positioning him and herself to keep from falling out of the chair and get his head on her shoulder looked like so much effort.

I changed my tail to legs and left. The watchers in the room followed and one butt in to notify the priest, but once I was out the door, I was gone. The oxenfolk devil had rushed to the door and stood there, confounded.

A watcher stopped at their side. He passed by them, waving for them to follow, and made his way back to his desk. The other priest had run to fetch the temple priest and the priest addressed the priestess, asking her opinion. The watcher waited to the side.

What the three gleaned from the readings made no sense to them. It was clear by my malice that I was a ghost and a malady at that, then there was the fact I’d infected the one—actually two. The ghost light told them I was named Heartbreak, except in the maladies section of the almanac, there’s no malady named Heartbreak, nor a malady whose malice manifested like blood or with a symptom of deterioration to the face and throat. Maybe the one reading, denoting what they called a being’s signature, could explain all the duality of the other readings, but not only was this so abnormal, the two signatures they read were of an unknown entity and the Heavenly Emperor. There’s no way, was there.

When the two had almost talked themselves into a panic, the third priest arrived on the heels of the temple priest who smoothly separated the two and picked up the malice detector. Like most bird-wingedfolk, the temple priest towered over the other three by a couple feet, and when they sat, became even in height with them. The temple priest was an older androgynous undead with large falcon wings and a mane of black, brown, and white feathers. He began reviewing the readings, referring the almanac, and took the stylus, pushed the cartridge, and seemed to write some quick calculations here and there. The other three watched and studied the temple priest’s calculations. They dug out scrolls from their sleeves to take notes and huddled together to whisper, trying to figure out what calculations the temple priest was doing, when, why, and the relevance of each result.

The temple priest gleaned a great deal more from the readings, but when they stopped, for a moment, they were still and silent. There were in fact two entities detected in my malice and one of them was indeed the Heavenly Emperor. By their calculations, they were able to discern that it wasn’t a shared existence or two root but one containing a part of the other. As all head and temple priests convened each year to receive the knowledge of the little goddess, the temple priest was familiar with the readings of the Heavenly Emperor, so far as was known by the little goddess herself. Apart from discerning the nature of the dual entites, his calculations were to confirm and factor out the Heavenly Emperor’s, so that he could see if what was left was complete and if it was, what the containing body was.

According to their readings, I was a superiorfolk—what else could I be if mixed—with a mix of wind, whispering—or maybe runes with whispering traits—and sea. My wings were of Time. I was some kind of immortal creature with the properties of a malady, made from the essence of a god other than those of these lands. Naturally, my being was absent from the shadows, so knowledge and instruments would always be a bit skewed, even this malice detector. Most creatures had at least five points in their fate shared with the rest of the community and then at least four of their own. These were all subjective, since assessing one’s fate was like studying a momentary image, but many of them were persistent and so developed the belief that fate was inevitable and unchangeable. According to their readings, my fate had no such points, only “threads” seemingly shared between the god of reflections and the god of love and death.

The temple priest didn’t know what to do, then found himself looking at the man and woman with my infection. With a wave of his hand, the watcher who’d been waiting to the side vanished, sent to find the High Priestess. Catching the woman’s attention, the temple priest asked for some of her blood. He pulled out another instrument that looked like a smaller version of the malice detector. She held out her arm. He had no trouble leaning over the desk and reaching for her finger to prick over the infection analyzer. When he pulled back, he and the other three watched the blood spread thin and the characters and symbols lit up as the measurements were taken.

Even once the High Priestess arrived, there wasn’t much they could do with any of it. The High Priestess didn’t want to involve their little goddess unless necessary, and she often thought much of her clergy were annoying ans incompetent, so none of them would dare to make the suggestion. They could reach out to the Heaven of Suuriratke, notify them and hope either a representative or the emperor himself came to handle it. It’d cause quite the stir up there, since no one outside that heaven was to know what happened to the Heavenly Emperor, or rather, what he’d done and where he was because of it.

The temple stood on the corner of an intersection, two streets from the South Boulevard. The temple doors faced east, while the temple gates faced south. Even on the edge of the central sector the streets were filled with people milling above and on the ground. Such a crowded city. Vendors lined the streets, their carts and stalls covered by large red parasols. There stalls on the roofs with more vendors meeting the flyers and gliders. Lanterns hung from the eaves of the roofs, the parasols, and posts in the middle of the intersections. Right out of the temple gates, the other three buildings forming the corners of the intersection were a gambling den, news shop, and winehouse. Every house along these streets had a tiered roof with at least two stacks reminiscent of pagodas, standing in the corners or ends. They were actually shrines to other deities, mostly from Sutmen, and the saints—or rather beauties—of Suuriratke. They were called saints, but in Suuriratke, beauty was one of the foremost virtues, so saints were often exceptional beauties.

In the gambling den, there were tables everywhere. The spaces were divided by sliding doors left open so people could wander from room to room. In the first few rooms, the tables featured people playing games of cards, dice, and tiles. They had chips and taels to bet against each other. Men and women in long purple robes—the den’s bookkeepers—wandered from table to table, keeping counts and tallies. They had lists of names in their hands and glancing over players, they’d look up a name or write a new one and make a note. They didn’t use numbers and characters, rather they used the accounting script, a shorthand code for accountants and merchants. Once in a while, one of them would smile as they walked away, tucking the lists in their sleeve, and would leave the room, heading further in. In the very back of the den, in the last room was a dias with a canopy swathed in an embroidered gold net. On the dias reclined a cut-tailed vixen, draped in purple and dark red, embroidered with gold peacocks and twelve-tailed foxes.

All the rooms past the outermost ones, upstairs and surrounding the furthest room in the back with the dais contained betting tables. Each had a caller. At tables where people were betting on cards, dice, and roulettes, the caller was also the dealer. The betting at other tables were on people and events as in the rise of a courtesan’s popularity, awards, wins and losses of cock fighters, even the gamblers of the den, how much they’d win and lose. One could bet money and assets, but those weren’t worth much in a city of the dead, unabashedly proud of being a den of thieves.

The whole building was polished wood, no carpets or rugs to catch any mutilations or the spill of wine and vomit. Bet an arm, bet a daughter, bet a house. Cleaners came by for collection and sweeping. On the walls hung paintings of beautiful men and women and tapestries of street scenes. At the center of the building with stairs to the second and third floors was the atrium. Sparkling purple streams seemed to materialize from the floor, climbing every pillar and the rails of the stairs. The atrium was the only space with open seating and service of food and drink. From the third floor wafted green and blue smoke. Crystal chandeliers were positioned in the air in a spiral, each reminiscent of a miniature floating city with a bobbing sprite in every compartment. The stairs spiraled in a square, the steps so wide a grown man could lay across them comfortably and that seemed the point with several drunkards passed out and patrons collected around them, chatting.

“Mm,  a malady in my den.” From past the net, the cut-tailed vixen watched me, a feral smile curled round the tip of his pipe. His voice was sweet and soft as if he were speaking next to my ear. “Come here and join me.”

“I don’t have any gossip.”

He chuckled. “Then I have something to tell you.”

“You want to gossip.”

“Me?” He chuckled. “When wouldn’ I. It’s always fun to dirty someone, so much more their reputation.”

I made my way to his dias. With a gesture of his paw, a servant pulled aside the net for me. When I didn’t move, something shoved me forward and the net fell behind me. I wasn’t solid anymore, so I don’t know what managed to touch me. The cut-tailed vixen threw back his head and cackled, his cut tails whipping and snapping in the air behind him. A stool was placed beside him. With a sigh and lazy smile, he gazed at me and gestured for me to sit.

“You have wings.” His smile broadened and exposed a canine.

“You can see me.”

“Not the usual malady, are you.”

“Not the usual cut-tail, are you.”

His eyes narrowed. “You have wonderful timing.”

“You have an opportunity.”

“I always do.” He scrutinized me, a soft smirk curling along his lips. After a moment, his gaze softened and his head fell to the side. “You have two forms, I see, and two heartbeats. Mind sharing with me?”

“Share?”

“How is a malady not a malady, containing a heart and the heart of the Heavenly Emperor?”

“Didn’t you have something to tell me?”

He sucked on his pipe and blew a puff of smoke at me.  With a shrug, he said, “We’ll leave this for later then.” He peered out at his den. “One of my crows tells me you’re named Heartbreak. What a gruesome affliction you are.”

“You have someone.”

“Maybe. I sure hope so.” They could just show me the person, then I’d see. “I have a problem and he refuses to leave one of my dears alone.” He gestured offhandedly towards his attendants. “If he was careful, I could turn a blind eye to his misdemeanors.” His face darkened and the markings of the fox glowed a menacing green. He bared his sharp canines as he grinned at me. “He will not stop, will not listen. I can’t kill him nor dispose of him, but every time he manages to get her alone or convince her he loves her, he’s too rough. Even she claims it’s just how rough they are. I,” he stressed proudly, “understand. I love it rough, but that’s sex with sadism—he uses sex to beat her as any poor man would his wife!” He growled and his eyes turned black.

“Where are they now?”

He stared at me. His eyes narrowed. He growled low and snapped, “The news shop. Getting married.”

“Now?”

“They’re waiting.”

“We can join them.”

Gold flashed across his pupils. He bared his canines, grinning. “I appreciate the company.” As he stood, his expression lightened and smoothed into ease and calm. “I hope he marries in hell.”

That’s the point.

The cut-tailed vixen held out his hand and one of his attendants slipped her hand in his as the net was drawn aside. I followed after them. He kept her hand raised as they strode through the den. Many stopped and hollered. Some called out a price for her, some called out a price for him. The bookkeepers all bowed their heads as he passed.

Once out the front doors, we only had to cross the street. Despite all the people, parasols, and vendors, when they saw the cut-tailed vixen, space was given and we crossed the street in a bubble.

The news shop was the smallest corner house. It had two floors and probably just a few rooms on each floor. Official business took place upstairs and rather than enter, we took the stairs along the side of the building to a landing with a red door. The attendant opened the door, letting the cut-tailed vixen and I enter first.

It was a reception room. There were two women with newborns, a family with two parents and three children, a pair of men with their backs to one another, and two couples, waiting arm-in-arm. They were all awaiting their turn for a meeting with the census keeper.

“Can I have all of them?”

“Hello,” called out the receptionist, then they recognized the cut-tailed vixen. They glanced at one of the couples. A young woman in a purple dress, a gold peacock embroidered on her shoulder, realized the cut-tailed vixen was here and sat up with a pleading smile. “Are you here for—”

The cut-tailed vixen strode over and seized the young woman in purple. He jumped back with her before the other man could catch him. Holding the young woman behind him, the cut-tailed growled. Instead of yelling at him, the man yelled at the young woman, something about a promise. She promised him and the young woman agreed, but she didn’t want to do it anymore. More than once, she tried to tell him why and end their promise, even trying to negotiate—she’s the cut-tailed’s sister, she knows how to negotiate, but the man would accept nothing else. They had a promise.

The cut-tailed whipped his attention to me and snapped, “You can have them all, you may have your pick at my den. Just get rid of it!”

The promise she made was binding. Fate connected her to the man in the past, it was malleable now. The only certainty at the moment was the promise and since there was no fate in their future, it was easy enough. No fate in their future, that’s odd. “Leave.”

The cut-tailed picked her up and dashed out. With the slam of the door, I released my malice. It was so thick, the children all drowned. The receptionist, the parents, the couples, and the man couldn’t even react as red burst forth and surged against the walls, rising and filling the room. Red light poured through the staircase, seeping under the doors to the office, dressing room, and landing. Fifteen bodies sunk to the floor, asleep. As my malice receded, the walls were stained in red. It dripped from the chairs and lights as it faded.

In the office, there was the census keeper huddled behind their desk and a man who held a young girl close, shielding her from the door. The census keeper was an androgynous bat wingedfolk, the man a bloodfolk demon, and the girl a bloodfolk undead. Father and daughter reunited. People downstairs peered at and through the ceiling, murmuring, a little excited. Watchers gathered above and below.

Pearls of memories.

The necklace materialized and I plucked off one pearl at a time. As I dropped them, they rolled to the bodies, enveloping them and shrinking back down. When I held out my hand, the pearls returned to me and sunk into the palm of my hand. It felt awkward to make a fist. I lowered my wings and melded them into my back. My wind and water materialized around me as my body shifted into wind and water.

Seeping into the wood, I followed the railing to the ground. A watcher struck at the puddle I formed. Though parts of me flew up with the impact, I dove into the dirt. They kept trying to strike the ground deeper and deeper as I slithered my way across the street. One managed a handful of dirt with some of my wind and water in it. There was a barrier around their hand, so I went through their veins into their wrist then forearm and out. I didn’t hurt them.

Once under the gambling den, I made my way up and into the pipes. Twisting left and right and left against hollowed wood, sifting through pumice stones, all the debris was removed from my being. Pumped out, up and up, I came out a spout and joined more water in a bucket. When I looked up, the cook looked down. It was a riverfolk ghost, they smelled like sweet fish. “Hi.”

“Hi. Can you boil?”

“I think so.” It’ll be uncomfortable.

“Soup, no soup?”

“No soup please.”

“You want soup later?”

“Yes please.”

The cook laughed and carried the basin away from the sink. I was jostled from side to side and I didn’t mind. Feeling like a fish, I swirled around. Things were yelled and called out. There were laughs, cackles, and hollers. They cussed out the customers and dished their dirty laundry over and over. I was poured into a pot. Since I’d have to boil, I swam round and round, splashing as if I had any feet. The cook leaned over and looked at me. “You okay?”

Yup, yup.

“Lighting the fire.” As the fire warmed the bottom, the cook grabbed a black chicken ghost and a black turtle ghost and threw them in. Twisted and stirred, I glared at the chicken and the turtle. The chicken glared back. The two of us were agreed. Being boiled was so unpleasant, we would get through this by hating each other—at least for the first minute. The cook stirred us with a spoon. They didn’t add any spices, I said no soup.

As the water bubbled and steamed, I took to stirring myself. The bubbles felt no different from waves of revulsion. The chicken squawked at me and the turtle made a faint, high-pitched screaming, drowned out by the squawking. Soon, the cook fought with the chicken to keep them down. Circling was tiring but if I stayed still, I’d vaporize and condense repeatedly, there’s a reason I hate heat.

Time seemed to slow and speed up. I couldn’t tell if time was passing or not, but Time was part of me and I felt the seconds becoming minutes.

We were almost done when the cut-tailed vixen came storming in, crying “Where are they!” I don’t know how they all knew but every one of the cooks pointed at my pot. The chicken and cook stilled and looked at me. I’m almost done cooking the turtle and chicken, I’m almost done.

The cut-tailed vixen ran up to the pot and looked in aghast.The cook and chicken looked at each other, then down at me. “It’s almost done.”

“It’s almost—Do you want to be in there,” they cried.

No, but we’re going to be delicious! I peeked at them, continuing to swirl.

Dumbfounded, the cut-tailed vixen threw up his hands and moved to the side. With a clack, he unfurled his fan and fanned himself vigorously. He glared at the cook who was unfazed and resumed fighting with the chicken. Almost done. The water around me was infused with malice. The turtle’s and chicken’s mixed to form a dark earthy green. Theirs mixed steadily. Mine required stirring and swirling and the heat to mix with theirs, originally a glowing thick purple amid the earthy green, but now a satisfying blackish brown with dark, curling vapors. It wasn’t exactly my malice released into the water, it was the pearls of memories. The trapped souls had manifested ghosts and the malice of those ghosts was stripped by the heat. I’ll release the souls later and dump the bodies at the temple. The ghosts, I get to eat them.

“Ha HAH!” A voice boomed. “Aren, what’re you doing in my kitchen?” Beside the cut-tailed vixen materialized a looming, pot-bellied man of many folds and smiling eyes, dressed in white robes with a red apron and sky blue ribbon wrapped twice round his hips. He was a catfolk demon, summoning spells cut and carved out of his arms and chest. The one earring he wore contained all the malicious and benevolent spirits he commanded, and his presence infused the air and every wall and surface of the kitchen. When he laughed again, it was a deep, full “Ho ho, ha!”

“You look upset!” He lumbered over and looked in the pot. His smiling eyes opened, gazing at me as a cattish grin spread across his face. “Ho ho, what have we here. Hello malady!”

I bobbed along, lazily circling. The big cook straightened and stepped away with a wave of his paw. The cook from before threw the black chicken ghost into a basket against the wall, the lid falling closed upon impact to reveal a sealing talisman. They were nicer to the black turtle and actually bothered to walk over. The cook got a long fork, but just as they turned to the pot, the big cook came forward, and offered his paw. It looked like he was expecting a handshake from soup.

I raised my wind and encircled his hand. Surprised, he flinched back with an “Oh ho.”

The cut-tailed vixen paused with interest. “Surprises, surprises.” He smiled. “A superior with wind ,” he stressed, “and water.”

“Oh?” The big cook offered his paw once more, “She must be a newcomer then. You received word from the temple.” He chuckled as I coiled round his hand. Holding it up, he grinned at me. “Already in with this troublemaker and just after your welcome, hm?” He glanced sideways at the cut-tailed vixen who shrugged and looked away, lazily fanning himself. “You’re indeed lucky she came, Aren. Have you thanked her yet?”

The cut-tailed vixen turned to him with a huff. “She got cooked in a pot!”

Big cook coughed in his throat, keeping a straight face. “Well now she’s out.” The two stared at each other.

“What.”

Big cook looked at me. “I’ll teach him some manners later. What do you think of your timing, little one?”

Little one? I could go with that. Uncurling and flinging out my wings, I shrunk down to the size of a housecat, changing from my wind and water form to my wings and serpentine tail. With a dive, I swooped up and flew to the big cook’s shoulders and perched like a cat. He bellowed with laughter. His shoulders shook, all of him seemed to be shaking. When I looked at the cut-tailed vixen, he was smiling and rolled his eyes. “What a fit,” declared the big cook. “Now then.” He plucked a sweet cracker from one of the other cook’s workstations and handed it to me as he turned, walking for the door. “Let’s have a tour, hm?”

The cut-tailed vixen followed a few steps behind, lazily fanning himself, and gave a cursory glance round the kitchen as we left.

# Dead Men Tales

## Spider

“Ha!” She chuckled. “Is that what you did.” She raised her hands, limply, hiding her fangs and eyes. “How magnanimous. How mystical. How…I don’t think I’ve ever felt so insulted.” Another two of her eyes opened. Her shoulders shook as she huffed a laugh. She nodded and looked around herself. The weathered stone of the abandoned courtyard, her exquisitely embroidered waves of silken red and green, the red powder tinting her dark skin, clinging to her long bleached hair and all the little hairs of her body, her glimmering gold claw hoods, finger bracelets, and rings. Her fingers tensed, flexing her claws. She turned to me.

“I,” she stressed, flinging her hands aside, “I,” snarling, revealing her long curved fangs, “I am A-hyre mon Makuan. I. I am A-hyre mon Makuan!” All four of her eyes wide open, a strained chuckle escaped her. “Was I inadequate, was I lacking—no hope for me, not for a kuan like me.” She laughs, gasps, and laughs louder, eyes wide, wet, and wild. No, she thought, not just any__a makuan, a makuan. The word had never been so bitter, so hard to swallow. Years of resignation, of knowing, of triumph, yet it shamed her all the same.

“Thank you!”

She smiled, a twitchy spread of her lips, eyes still wide and wet. No tears would fall, not yet, but they were there. “It’s for the best, isn’t it—this! This is what I asked for, isn’t it. This is what I wanted, isn’t it.” She stumbled back and started to laugh dry, bitter chuckles, managing an “I” until she suddenly remembered her father. He called her name and laughed, praising the third whip she’d ever made. All four eyes open, he turned to her mother, looking for the woman’s fanged smile, and instantly saw it. Spinning back to her, he smiled even bigger, exposing the full length of his fangs, brimming with pride as he declared her a future master. Her mother and older sister whooed together and laughed. “I wasn’t__good, was I. A whore.” A hollow laugh, the tears swelled and leaked onto and along her cheeks and ears, sliding along her jaw. “A mynsankul-kuan,” she shrugged, defeated, seeing all their smiling faces, “makuan.”

Her mind blanked. Her body straightened, assuming its usual posture. She was a lady of pleasure and a spiderfolk. Proud and dangerous. The sea of helplessness poured back in and inside, she’d never felt so far away, so singular and alone, since the moment nine years ago that she remembered five blood-stained bodies scattered around the one-room house she’d once lived in. The walls behind them were bare. The bundles of silk and the webs she’d made with her older siblings. All the whips of chains, leather, hair, and silk, feathered, bejeweled, multi-tailed. A whip with a handle cast in bronze and every snake scale carved, braided tails of hair with jade arrow tips, a long winding strip of hardened leather with a sharpened iron nail as its end. Gone. The heritage and pride of her family was never found. As she remembered, hiding behind stairs at the house of pleasure she then resided at, the reality that she didn’t have a family anymore sunk deep into her bones and rooted in the marrow. Remembering the moment she’d remembered and realized, her face twisted into the face of that twelve-year-old girl crying, sobbing, thinking of the girl who found the five bodies, too shocked to cry until blood, blood, blood, she’d screamed. Screamed and screamed, knowing most likely the thieves were long gone and she would never avenge her family. She would never see them again.

Her eyes and expression, the chain of memories, were seared into my eyes. They were all I saw, whether open or closed. Her words echoed and repeated, a jumbled mess of “I am A-hyre mon Makuan.”

“Thank you!”

“I wasn’t__good, was I.”

“I don’t think I’ve ever felt so insulted.”

“Ha!”

This. This. Even if I covered my ears and shut my eyes, and all of my city and my people disappeared, I’d still see the eyes, the expression, and the memories. I’d still hear “I don’t think I’ve ever felt so insulted.”

“Was I inadequate, was I lacking—”

“This is what I wanted, wasn’t it.”

“How mystical.”

“Is that what you did.”

Fifty days. It’s been fifty days since I first met her. Ni Nase prayed to me, asking me to find her a husband. Week after week, same day, same hour, same minute and number of seconds, the same abandoned courtyard, the same spot behind the ruins of a small temple, the same kneeling pose, every movement and every distance, the same exact words with the same inflections and tones, the same pacing of speech—mortals are supposed to be inconsistent and imprecise. It didn’t matter what folk they were. They can’t—shouldn’t be so measured, so exact. The moment I heard her above all other voices and prayers, shivering as my gut knotted, I knew it was the fourth week. Four times. How. How could a mortal do this.

Five. The fifth week, the fifth time. Again! I clutched my gut and braced myself on the floor, as if my body were being shaken apart. Trying not to sweat from the strain and stress. What perfect repetition.

Six. I fell to my knees, shaking violently, my whole body convulsing. It felt as if my insides were being twisted and squeezed, the fibers of my muscles vibrating like strings. I thought of the victims of ymletme, their flesh shriveling up and shrinking, the acid, blood, excrement, and urine squeezed out of their bodies in piles of sludge as their skin dried until cracked and flaking. When she finally stopped, my clothes smelled sweet, coated on the inside by a milky white, paste-like substance that’d oozed through my clothes, over my hands, onto my collar, and down my ankles. I couldn’t move and my body kept sweating. Puddles of sap formed. I hoped no one other than one of my servants or family found me. As my body lied still and motionless, I recalled the experiences of the ymletme victims and waded in the shadows.

Seven.

I clutched the nearest shadow and tumbled through.

In my presence, she was taken to the border of sleep, no longer conscious but aware. In her waking dream, she was still praying, only to shiver and hold her breath, surprised. She whirled around, all the hairs on her body swaying, vaguely aware something was off about the ruins of the temple and the abandoned courtyard. She rose to her feet and looked at one of the crumbled walls, the face of the statue in pieces worn away by time, the weathered stones at her feet and the moss growing in their cracks, except she wasn’t looking, she didn’t try to focus. She didn’t even notice that she wasn’t wearing her veil anymore.

Turning back to resume her prayer, she felt me before she saw me. She spun about.

To her, I was a pale-skinned creature wearing torn layers of black dresses, long, short, cotton, silk, linen, lace, bells, coins, spots, stripes, lattices, embroidered, jacquard, damask. The layers shifted continuously, morphing and changing their patterns, materials, and embellishments if she wasn’t looking. My limbs were long and thin with three-fingered claws. My torso, neck, and head were stretched and strained. Without eyes, a black paint leaked from eight empty sockets.  When I opened my mouth, my teeth were sharp and jagged in two rows, exposing the full length of two black curved fangs. The only thing I retained was the drip of my sap from my fangs.

As I approached her, she didn’t flinch or avert her gaze. My steps were uneven, my form swaying, forced to creep toward her, the air resisting my every movement. The shreds of the dresses undulated. My limbs flicked and twitched. Sap dribbled down my chin.

“Momo.”

## Gales

Makun. Lalan.

“Where are you going? It’s still morning.”

“She’s probably going to visit that matchmaker. Momo?”

Mn.

Mother frowns. “Is the prayer still unanswered?”

It’s been answered.

Father cocks a brow. Mother’s hair sways and snaps like a whip. “Then why are you going to the matchmaker—don’t!” Glares at father. “You even insinuate. You will sleep in momo’s room until this is settled.” It’s an empty threat, but he doesn’t know yet.

He swallowed back a chuckle and his ears flattened. He was a little disappointed he couldn’t say, Just don’t come back with a husband, Unless he’s useful, Has a big penis, At least three wives—it’d be so easy. But it’s the middle of mating season. Mother still hates this half of the year. “Absolutely not,” he affirmed. Couldn’t help himself. “Anyone good-looking?”

Mother huffed and it blew into his face, ruffling his hair. He blinked it off and smiled at me. But. “Mobese. You know our daughter is twenty-eight.”

“Yes…” Her eyes narrow at him, “What about it?”

“She’s a virgin.”

Mother’s hair rose. Her robes fluttered. You!

Father didn’t have to guess what she was thinking. “I won’t,” he assured, “No jokes.”

Her hair didn’t settle, swaying about her, and her robes still fluttered. She glared at him.

Father was about to address me, but he realized what he was about to say would still count. He snorted and looked away from us.

Mother stared at his back, her hair rising up in waves.

Lalan.

“Mn. Yes, momo.”

Makun hasn’t paid back for last time.

Head shot up and looked at me. Mother’s hair fell. Her whole body went stiff.

If we’re playing with my kualyalo—

Mother’s hair whipped, waved, and rippled, unable to settle on any singular motion. Between my obvious intent and hearing mention of kualyalo bothered her. Father knowingly ignored it and turned to her, excited. “Mobese,” he begged, smiling. She looked between him and me.

This is my lamain.

She hated that reply. Her body rippled as she pursed her lips and turned her head away from him. Gone were thoughts of her parents and the mysterious grandfather she’d never met. He inched closer. She bristled. With a soft sigh, father stepped back and discarded his excitement. “Perhaps later then,” he whispered.

You never use force.

Looks at me. “You’re right. I don’t.” He raised a finger and smiled. “Mm?”

To force someone into sex or intimacy is the most telling sign of incompetence.

He grinned. Mother looked at me as if how could I still be saying those words. Twenty-eight, father’s past, the absurdity, she thought all at once. I’ve been reciting this line for eighteen years and my father’s past has never bothered me. Absurd.

My chest feels tight.

Makun.

Her shoulders drop as she sighs. Looking at me, she shook her head and muttered, “Finish it.” She looked away and waved my father off. It was morning, yet she was surrending for the day.

Lalan.

Something about me told him that mother was surrendering and had reason to surrender. Even if this early in the day. “What.” He gestured at her, but kept his hand down, even though she was turned the other way. Sometimes, he forgot that even windfolk like mother had a season—more like a summer every few years—and hers was starting.

I nodded.

He grinned and sighed with relief. Excited, he grabbed mother’s waist with a hum and brought her closer, but he didn’t hug her tight or lift her into his arms. She was still uncomfortable—especially uncomfortable now. Her body was chilling, making father’s heat near scorching to her. In spite of her age and claiming father as her bond fifteen years ago, between spaces, her body only remembered the hell it knew thirty-one years ago. When father touched her, half the time she had to quickly remind herself it was her bond touching her, not someone else. Bonded for fifteen years. Fifteen.

Makun.

“Mm, yes.”

Your answer.

She blanked, then looked confused. Her mind flipped from her surrender, setting aside her rising arousal, mention of the bet, and landed on the start of our conversation. She remembered my question—I’d asked twice and this was my fifth time reminding her. Her arms shot up in defense, pressing tight into her chest as her hands curled into fists. Her shoulders rose and tensed, and her hair billowed upward, brushing against my father’s face. He stepped back out of its way. A look of fear and uncertainty filled her eyes as her robes loosened and whirled around her. We both moved but with his arm holding her waist, father easily bent forward and wrapped his arms around her, angling his head to avoid her hair. Her chilled winds sliced and prickled the skin along his forehead, cheeks, jaw, and throat, whipping up his hair with hers.

He ignored any discomfort.

Pulling away one of his arms, he moved to stroke her cheek. She remains senseless, but she flinched unconsciously, his skin becoming scorching hot to her. He tried to keep his touch light, while standing among her billowing winds.

This reaction she’s had, that has only been happening since my first reminder of the question, it was little more than a windy day—nothing compared to her tempests which would shatter furniture and even tear doors from their rails and send tables and bookcases careening through the walls. This was foreign to us and mother always lost awareness when it happened, so she couldn’t tell us what thoughts or feelings arose from it.

He shuts his eyes and leans closer, carefully seeking to bump his head to hers, and peppers her temple with feather-light kisses.

Every time, her winds are first to start, rushing out from her core that sits so still, it’s like a heart that has stopped beating. Her whole being was in the between. There was nothing I could tell my kualma other than no feeling was conscious or distinct, any thoughts were a jumbled awareness of the unknown.

Switches arms to rest his hand on her back. He rubs back and forth between her back and shoulder. His lips had slid to her ear. He utters whatever cajoling words he can muster, hoping to comfort her. Her wind has weakened, much of it now circulating through her. Her hands shake.

“Momo.” Rests his head against hers. She shuts her eyes. Father felt the slight dip of her head with a little relief that she was already starting to stir this time.

I will visit the matchmaker.

“No husband. My beautiful mane.” Mother’s brow twitches.

She wears nice clothes.

“So,” he snorts with a small smile, “she matches people with clothing? No wonder all her clients are suddenly so. Appealing.” Mother’s brows furrow.

She hopes one day for me.

“That you might learn some sense of style, finally?”

That would be interesting.

“It’s a good thing your mother’s like this. She finds that woman appalling.” A small huff from her nose.

She’s met the matchmaker.

“She was buying cloth for page binding.”

Mm. They’re nearly in front of one another. She didn’t take offense with you.

Laughs. “Well. Can’t say I’d like a northern Yan.”

She’s a northern Yan.

Nod. “She’s done well to hide it, but I’d never mistake one. They’re some of the most annoying people I’d ever had to deal with when I was establishing my reign.” Mother scowls.

Northern Yan is broadly dispersed, mostly consisting of tribes. Some nomadic, while others have been fighting over the main roads for decades.

He sighed, annoyed to think about his previous dealings with them. Some awareness had returned, her scowl deepened, and the urge to look at him incredulously was there. The way he remembered it said nothing. To mother and I, knowing my father from when we first met him, not caring how it affected his dealings with the men, he probably—so likely it’s guaranteed—seduced and bedded all of their wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters. Though he pursued absolute power in Yan Ka’ur, for twenty-four years of his life, he firmly believed that the measure of a man was his proven virility and competence. When we met him, evidence of my father’s virility and competence was eleven wives, over a hundred concubines, and more than a hundred children ranging in age from recently born to twenty-one.

The moment my father saw my mother, he wanted her to join his harem, so to set the stage for courting her, he offered us a room at the palace. The first words my mother ever said to him were “I wish I could say I’m grateful, but how could I possibly allow momo to stay in such a dirty place. If you need, I can send for some people who would actually clean for you. Rather than allow all this filth.”

Father’s happy.

Mother has wrapped her arms tight around him and she’s willingly pressing into him, no matter that his heat is burning her. Her wind was slowly warming. She held so tight. If she’d had claws, my father’s back would be bleeding.

###

“Momo.”

Mn.

“Your mother will worry if you’re gone too long.” Mother’s breathing steadily. Her wind swirls as a gentle breeze. Father smiles. “Go. Come back soon.”

Yes, lalan.

“Momo. Walk there.”

The shadows are—

“You should walk there. Take your time going.”

I should think of why I’m going.

Looking at me. “You said the prayer was answered, you remember? Then. You have no reason to visit with her. But. Why do you want to know…?” Mother, I’d asked twice and reminded her a fifth time. He wanted to know why I wanted an answer. “We’ll talk when you’re back.”

Father eased mother back. She released him and looked at him, tired. He scooped her up as she reached out her arms, muttering “Be careful of your back,” and rested against him, “Old boy.”

He chuckled, carrying her away. “I’m not old enough yet,” he said contentedly, “My beloved mare still needs to…” She smacked him. His laugh lingered in his wake.`
